# Group assignment 1.1: Ice Ice Baby

*Due: Friday 5th September, 2025. This assignment does not need to be turned in*

You can access this assignment on https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/workbook-2025/assignments/GA1.1/README.html. Pages can be downloaded as `.md` and `.ipynb` files to your computer.

This assignment is split into three main parts, all presented in the [analysis notebook](analysis.ipynb) :

1. The first half presents you with some information about modelling ice and asks you to evaluate some hypothetical models.
2. The second part asks you to run two simple models to predict the ice breakage day and discuss them.
3.  Here, some more ice models are presented and you are asked to assess them (no coding required).
   
You will need to answer the questions in the [report](./report.md) together as a group.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAND IN THIS REPORT. In subsequent weeks, you only need to hand in one report for the entire group.
