You can access this assignment with the following link: `classroom.github.com/a/<xxxxxxx>`.

This assignment is split into three main parts:

1. The first half presents you with some information about modelling ice and asks you to evaluate some hypothetical models.
2. The second part asks you to run two simple models to predict the ice breakage day and discuss them.
3. If you have time, you can do the third part. Here, some more complex ice models are presented and you can use these as inspiration to draft a conceptual model for modelling ice breakage (no coding required).
   
You will need to answer the questions in the report together as a group.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAND IN THIS REPORT. In subsequent weeks, you only need to hand in one report for the entire group.
