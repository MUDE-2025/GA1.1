    "The Nenana Ice Classic is an annual guessing game and fundraiser held in Nenana, Alaska.\n",
    "Each year you can bet on the day and time the river ice in the Tanana River will break apart along the waterfront of the town Nenana. (the town is called Nenana because it is located just upstream from the confluence of this tributary with the Tanana River). Below you can see its position, with a Netherlands for scale!\n",

    "A tripod is constructed on the ice during the first weekend in March. This tripod is connected to a clock via a pulley system on the shore. When the ice starts moving and the tripod drifts 100 feet downriver, the line tightens and triggers the clock to stop, marking the official break-up time. The record earliest break-up was in 2019 (April 14). The latest was in 1964 (May 20).\n",

    "### System Components\n",
    "The setup of the tripod and clock directly determines the definition of ice break-up: a rope is attached from the tripod to a clock on the riverbank. When the rope is pulled tight it stops the clock; this time is used to determine the winning guess of the breakup day and time (down to the minute). As such, these components could be interesting to include in a model. A diagram of the setup is shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Diagram by Robert Lanzafame*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available data and scale\n",
    "When building a model to predict the breakup time, it is essential to consider the scale of the data available. As a general rule, larger scale data shows overall trends but may be too generic while smaller-scale data has more variation as the data is not smoothed by averaged effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **local scale** concerns itself with the data collected in Nenana itself or immediately around the Tanana River at the town. It's the most fine-grained and directly related to the tripod and ice. Examples include the local river discharge and ice thickness (although this is extremely difficult to measure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the **watershed scale** includes data pertaining to the Tanana River watershed, including upstream areas that feed into the Tanana. This includes regions like the Alaska Range, tributaries (including Nenana!), and snowfields. An example is the annual snowpack and precipitation rates in the Alaska Range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **regional data** covers a larger area than local or watershed scale — for example, Interior Alaska or the entire state. It captures trends affecting multiple towns, rivers, and ecosystems. We can, for instance, look at the sun hours of the region to estimate the amount of solar radiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **global scale** refers to planet-wide systems that can affect Alaska indirectly, including the little town of Nenana. Average global temperatures is perhaps the most well known measure for this. And we have indeed seen a direct correlation between the average global temperature and ice breakup date!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a table showing some examples of data at the scales discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![data](images/data.png \"data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Sources: [USGC data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dvstat), [NOAA data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov), [CRU data](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/data/), [BerkeleyEarth](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/)\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a model, you should consider using different scales. Long-term global and regional trends give you the “big picture.” While the watershed and local scale tells you how much gives you information that is more precisely related to the ice breakage."
