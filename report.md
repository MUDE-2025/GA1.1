## Part 1

For part 1, Try splitting into pairs within your group and each choose a model to consider, then after a few minutes regroup and explain your results to each other. Please refer to the book if you are unsure about any terms.

The question below refers to the 4 examples in Part 1 of the notebook.

**1.1 Classify the models in the examples using the categories in the textbook. Please provide an explanation of your choice.**

**1.2 Place each model on the tradeoff triangle (shown below) and provide an explanation of your choice.**

**1.3 What simplifications are made in the models?**

**1.4 What types of uncertainty are the models affected by?**


## Part 2

Before answering these questions, please work through Part 2 of the notebook.

**2.1 For model 1, what does the coefficient of determination $R^2$ tell you?. What can you conclude from this?**


**2.2 For model 1, describe the resulting two plots. What can you conclude from this?**


**2.3 For model 1, what can you conclude from looking at the error bars? Would you have confidence in this model?**


**2.4 For model 2, please describe the resulting two plots. What can you conclude from this? Looking at the error bars, would you have confidence in this model?**


**2.5 Which model, if any, do you think is better according to Goodness of Fit metrics? Why?**


## Part 3

**3.1 (Optional but recommended) Based on these models and the data you have available, make a prediction for the ice breakup for next year!**


**3.2 (Optional but recommended) Outline your own conceptual model based on what you have learned in the notebook. Explain your choices.**
